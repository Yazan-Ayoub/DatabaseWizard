📊 Relational Database Builder Tool
Project Description

This project is a lightweight tool designed to quickly create and manage relational databases in a clear and structured way. It helps developers define tables, relationships, and constraints without the overhead of complex database design tools.

The goal of this tool is to simplify the early stages of database modeling, making it easier to translate business requirements into a well-structured relational database schema.

Key Features

Create relational databases from scratch

Define tables, columns, and data types

Configure primary keys and foreign key relationships

Enforce basic constraints (nullable, unique, references)

Generate a clean database structure ready for implementation

Designed to be simple, fast, and developer-friendly

Use Cases

Rapid prototyping of database schemas

Learning and practicing relational database design

Small projects or internal tools

Preparing schemas before implementation in SQL / ORM frameworks

Scope

This is a small, focused utility intended for clarity and productivity—not a full enterprise database designer. It prioritizes simplicity, correctness, and ease of use.
